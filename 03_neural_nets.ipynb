    "Although, at the present moment, the result of training a neural network is something of a black box, its operation does not have to be! Knowing what's going on inside of a neural network, from end-to-end, will allow you go beyond simple hacking to solve new problems with novel architectures of your own design. Thus, before we start mucking around with code, let's take a gander at what that code aims to do!\n",
    "\n",
    "## It's all in your head...\n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network, as the name suggests, can be usefully imagined as a collection of neurons, each of which takes one or more inputs and produces one or more outputs. When all of a neuron's connections are from/to other neurons, we refer to that neuron as *hidden*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it also helps to group neurons that participate in computing the same function into *layers*. In a feed-forward neural network, like the one shown in Figure 1, the outputs of one layer are the inputs to the next. \n",

    "<div class=\"figcaption\">Figure 1: A simple, feed-forward network with one hidden layer</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a layer can have arbitrary connections, but you don't have to worry about that now. As a bit of a teaser, later on in the workshop, we'll circle back around and build a *recurrent* neural network in which layers have self-connections through time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## ...except when it's on the [CG]PU\n",
    "\n",
    "While neurons and layers are certainly convenient metaphors, we have to reformulate these abstract concepts in a way that a computer can understand! And what better format to use than numbers and simple operations on them?\n",
    "\n",
    "The operations performed by neural networks are most elegantly described using vector calculus, which you, too, will hopefully understand. If you'd like another perspective, though, the [Hacker's guide to Neural Networks](https://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/) offers a more code-oriented approach (but don't worry, we'll get to teh c0dez soon enough!).\n",

    "\n",
    "Okay, now let's take a step back and look at our Perceptron from a different perspective. Recall the equation for a line in 2D: $ax_1 + bx_2 + c= 0$. Huh, that looks like what Perceptron is doing! That's because the inner product, $w^Tx$ actually represents the distance from a line! The line, itself, is where the inner product is zero (i.e. when $w$ and $x$ are perpendicular).\n",

    "To make things concrete, suppose we're interested in determining the sentiment of product reviews (major snoozeville, I know, but bear with me). Our reviews contain two features, $x_1$ and $x_2$, which will represent, say, the number of stars and the number of speling erors. Additionally, a subset of them are labeled as \"positive,\" \"neutral,\" and \"negative.\" Our task is determine which reviews are polarized--either positive or negative--and assign those a $+1$ while giving the neural reviews $-1$. We will accomplish this by updating Perceptron's weights so that it performs well on the training set; the hope is for the learned classifier to *generalize* and perform well on the test set, too!\n",

    "So far, we've been relying on the little-studied, black-box training algorithm known as \"Nick draws some lines that look right.\" Unfortunately, this algorithm breaks down fairly quickly as the size of the data increases. We need something more robust!\n",

    "\n",
    "Say our loss function is $\\mathcal{L}(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2}(y - f(x))^2$. Essentially, we want the output of our neural network, $f(x)$, to be as close as possible, in terms of Euclidean (or $\\ell_2$) distance, to our desired output $y$. This is to say that we want to minimize $\\mathcal{L}(x, y)$. From calculus, we know that, by taking the derivative, we can find the direction in which a variable can be nudged to increase the function the most. In this case, the only thing we can change is $f(x)$:\n",

    "\n",
    "Okay, we now know how to adjust $f(x)$ to make it look more like our desired output. Unfortunately, we can't just go and directly change $f(x)$ because it's actually some complicated, multi-layer neural network. We *can*, however, adjust the *parameters* (i.e. weights) of the network to change the function it computes; all that's needed is $\\partial\\mathcal{L}/\\partial W^{(i)}$ for each layer $i \\in [1..n]$ in the network!\n",

The gist is that, at the end of the day, you'll be running your network on data it's never seen before. While it's easy to get a model that performs very well during training (e.g., by memorizing the training data), for it to be useful, it has to *generalize* to unseen data; this is where the learning occurs.\n",
