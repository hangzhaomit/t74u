    "* Torch and Tensors\n",
    "* the `nn` library\n",
    "* how to classify MNIST digits with reasonable accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "that's quite the accomplishment! Well, you're 97% of the way there; just 2.7% to go, right? Let us forge onward!\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until now, we've been treating an MNIST digit as a really, really big vector. This is odd because, as far as the network knows, each component/pixel is independent of the rest. Since the input is actually a 2D image, we know that this isn't the case! How, then, can we take advantage of this additional structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to stick with linear layers, we could try connecting each $3\\times 3$ neighborhood of pixels to a single output. In that case, if we had a $5\\times 5$ image, we'd have four separate `nn.Linear` modules producing a $3\\times 3$ output. That's not too bad except it assumes that the information learned about the top left neighborhood is independent from that learned about the bottom right. For instance, if we wanted to detect a 1, we'd need a vertical line detector; a repeated-linear network would have to learn this same detector for every position in the image!\n",
    "\n",
    "Much better would be to, instead, learn a bunch of different $n\\times n$ *filters* to slide (or \"*convolve*\") over each $n\\times n$ neighborhood in the image. Now, you can have one filter that detects horizontal edges, another one that detects vertical edges, and possibly even one that detects the holes inside of 0s and 9s! The best part is that now you only have to learn $n^2 \\cdot numFilters$ parameters instead of $n^2 \\cdot (N-2)^2$, which speeds up computation and helps stave off overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this doesn't make sense yet, don't fret. First, check out this diagram of the computation performed during an application of a convolutional filter.\n",

    "<div class=\"figcaption\">Figure 1: Computation performed during an application of a single conv filter.</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Still considering the image in Figure 1, to produce the entire *output feature map*, one must simply apply the conv filter at every valid location in the image. Note that, due to edge effects, the output feature map has size $o = N - n + 1$ (where $N$ is the input size and $n$ is the kernel/filter size).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you grok the previous bit, this next part should be a simple extension: if you have $f$ filters, applying all of them to an input will give you $f$ output feature maps. You can then stack those up into a *volume* of size $f\\times o \\times o$ and feed them into the next conv layer. This is to say that, in general, the input to a single conv filter is an $f \\times n \\times n$ volume. In fact, you can think of an RGB image as a special case of a conv volume where each channel is one feature map (albeit one that is highly correlated with the others). \n",

    "\n",
    "As each feature map goes through more and more convolutional layers, the features become increasingly abstract. For example, your first layer might contain a horizontal and vertical edge detector. In the second layer, a filer could then combine the feature maps of the - and | detectors to yield a + detector! \n",
    "\n",
    "If diagrams aren't your style and you prefer the cold, hard code the module of the hour is [`nn.SpatialConvolution`](https://github.com/torch/nn/blob/master/doc/convolution.md#nn.SpatialConvolution):"
