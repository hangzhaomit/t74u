    "Excellent question! The short answer is that Lua is lightweight and has a [stellar interpreter](http://luajit.org/), that rivals the performance of C and provides easy access to compiled C and CUDA methods. The result is that, instead of defining a computation in a slow language (like Python) and running it in another language (c.f. Theano, TensorFlow), the Lua code that you write is actually what is run! This has a bunch of nifty benefits, the most important of which is debuggability. More on this later, though... First we must learn some moonspeak!"
